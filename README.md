# Error-Handling (Defensive Programming)

## Task 1
For both the errors.py and errors2.py task files in your folder, open the files and follow these steps:
1. Attempt to run the program. You will encounter various errors.
2. Fix the errors and then run the program.
3. Each time you fix an error, add a # comment in the line where you fixed it and indicate which of the three types of errors it was with a brief explanation of why that is.
4. Save the corrected file.

## Task 2
Follow these steps:
1. Create a new Python file called logic.py.
2. Write a program that displays a logical error (be as creative as possible!).

## Task 3
Follow these steps:
1. Create a new Python file called optional_challenge.py.
2. Write a program with two compilation errors, a runtime error and a logical error.
3. Next to each error, add a comment that explains what type of error it is and why it occurs.
